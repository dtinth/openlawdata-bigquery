IMPORTANT: This project uses `ezer`, a CLI companion for AI agents, to help maintains context and memory across sessions using git-backed storage.

- At the beginning of every session, you MUST run `ezer` (with no arguments) to load context and see usage instructions.
- The `ezer` CLI is already in your `PATH`, so you can just call it by name.
- You should work in small increments, and use the puzzles feature in ezer to break down a large task into managable pieces.
- You should also use the notes feature in ezer to capture learnings from the session, so that future sessions can benefit from your learning.
- Capture learnings as notes when you are able to overcome a problem, when a human user provides feedback on your work, or when a human user tells you to "remember" something, "note down" something, or "reflect" on your work.
- If you are unsure how to use ezer, just run `ezer` with no arguments, and it will show you usage instructions, along with current project context.
